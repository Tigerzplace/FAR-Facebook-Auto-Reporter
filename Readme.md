## Updates

### Update 1: Reporting From Multiple Accounts - (1 Oct 2020)
With Facebook Auto Reporter v1, users were able to report on multiple accounts, groups, or pages on Facebook with the current logged accounts automatically. Now in version 2, users will have advanced functionality using which they can report on multiple accounts using hundreds of Facebook accounts automatically.

### Update 2: Controlling and Enhancing the Reporting Speed (5 Oct 2020)
In previous version 1, the Facebook Auto Reporter was using a manual prediction algorithm to wait for another report. It is now more reliable and fast in version 2 because it is using a loading algorithm that will detect the action of the page event after which the reporter will decide whether to move on or to wait more to get done with the report completely.

### Update 3: Introduction of Batch System - (Apr 29 2024)
The reporting mechanism now efficiently divides report links across multiple accounts, enhancing the reporting workflow. For instance:
   - Account 1 reports on links 0-9, 10-19, 20-29
   - Account 2 follows the same pattern, and so on.
Many new updates in version 2.5.4, focuses on making your reporting experience more streamlined, intuitive, and efficient. Enjoy the new improvements and features designed to enhance your workflow!


## How to report on Facebook (Accounts/Groups/Pages) with Facebook Auto Reporter v2
To use Facebook Auto Reporter v2, users need to download it as it is not listed on the Chrome Store. Once downloaded, the software can be loaded in Chrome using the following steps:

Extract the inner folder (FAR2) anywhere you want.

* Go to your browser extension tab.
* Switch on the developer mode.
* Click the "Load Unpacked" button.
* Select the FAR2 folder which you extracted after downloading.
* You will get the FAR2 icon on the top right corner of the browser.
* There are two different use cases of the reporter:

### Use Case 1: Simple Reporting
In this case, users provide their short reporting links and click “Start Reporting”. The reporter will perform automatic reporting until the last link in the list is provided by the user. Once reporting is completed, the reporter will stop reporting and will notify the user with full reporting detail.

### Use Case 2: Persistent Reporting
In this case, the software allows the user to interact with the browser during reporting. Users can pause or stop the reporting process, add new links to the queue, and modify settings. This mode is recommended if users want to report multiple links at once.
