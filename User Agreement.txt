User Agreement 
I, the creator is not responsible for the use of the tool by users in any bad or abusive at all. I made this tool to get rid of accounts which is fake or even pages that are insulting, spreading hate speech or making any threat to country, person, or religion. So I am not responsible for other user's action using this tool. They can come up with some third party technique and abuse the tools But For my part, after a lot of thought., I concluded that it is likely that *something* I worked on in *some* way may be used to harm someone else and I have no control over that. However I made it in such a way to prevent any bad use at all so all reports are still checked by Facebook Team. I'll also make sure that in future no one can use this tool which can lead to any abusive use. But still I don't have any control over the internet user so I am not fully responsible for any other use then the one I made this for. :)
