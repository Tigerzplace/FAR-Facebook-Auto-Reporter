Purchase link:  http://bit.ly/Pay-To-Tigerzplace

You will have to visit the above link, it will redirect you to another payment page. There you have to pay $10 once you pay for a license. Then just send me your email and extension id. You can also leave your extension id in the payment comment box. You can find your extension id in the chrome extensions tab from where you first installed the extension. Or simply go to the License tab in the reporter and click "Check License", it will provide the details for purchasing a license.			

You can send me your extension id and email via mail: admin@tigerzplace.com. OR contact via any platform listed below. I am mostly active on Facebook.
