for the adult nudity category, it is moved to sexual exploitation, this is to fix reports that have technical errors because the group admin is a page or there is no admin
Deni
for this category of violence was moved to violence threat, reports of threats of violence experienced a technical error because almost all posts or photos or comments could be deleted, rather than hate speech
Deni
this is one proof that violence is a better choice than hate speech

const globel_url = [...]; // array of links to visit

  }

  const account = loginAccounts[currentAccount];
  const linksPerAccount = Math.floor(globel_url.length / ids_length);
  const startIndex = currentLink;
  const endIndex = startIndex + linksPerAccount;
  const linksToVisit = globel_url.slice(startIndex, endIndex);

  // use the account to visit the linksToVisit

  currentAccountIndex++;
  if (currentAccountIndex >= ids_length) {
    currentAccount = 0;
    currentLinkIndex += linksPerAccount;
  }

  visitLinks(globel_url, loginAccounts, ids_length, currentAccount, currentLink); // visit the next set of links
}

visitLinks(globel_url, loginAccounts, ids_length, 0, 0);
